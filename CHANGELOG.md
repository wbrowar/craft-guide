# Guide Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## 5.1.0 - 2024-10-12

> {warning} This update changes the behavior on how guides added to the **Control Panel Pages** group in the Guide Organizer are matched agains URIs in the Control Panel. The value of the **uri** field may need to be updated for each guide if you find that guides are appearing on the wrong pages in the Control Panel.

### Changed
- The **uri patter** field on guides added to the **Control Panel Pages** group now uses RegEx to match the **uri patter** field value to Control Panel URIs.
  - This makes it easier to put guides on muiltple pages in a section of the control panel. For tips on how to set up a URI pattern, see [the docs for the Guide Organizer](https://github.com/wbrowar/craft-guide/blob/main/src/templates/docs/en/guide-organizer.md).

### Fixed
- Fixed an error that occured where entering a value in **uri** field and it removed the first letter when a leading or trailing slash was present.
