![Guide 3](resources/img/guide-3-header.png)

Craft CMS is intuitive. Marketing plans and organizational workflows—not so much. Guide lets you create a user manual throughout Craft CMS so clients don‘t need to go far to get the answers they need.

Guide was built to be a CMS manual, but Guide 3 is also a quick way to create widgets and unique Craft CP pages, without the use of a custom module or knowledge of PHP.
